This project is an internal project developed at the group of electrical engineer tutorial education program (PETEEL). It aims to construct a Graber i3 3D printer. 

I was responsible to the electronical setup. All the elements were connected to the Arduinoâ€™s shield and a program was created to control the printer. The actuators are: there are three motors for the positioning, one motor in the wire extrusion, a hotend that melts the ABS plastic, a fan, and a heated table.
