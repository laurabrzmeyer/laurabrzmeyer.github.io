The access system project aims to monitor and control the access to a meeting room. The access can be required online using a form. If the administrator accepts the request, the person will have access to the meeting room with its university card at the slot time desired. 

The online form was created using HLTM and PHP scripts. The programming language JavaScript was used to create the application where the requests appears so the administrator can accept or denied the access.
