The changes that the project management model has undergone bring great advantages to companies, but new problems are introduced. In the classic methods of development, a project is carried out in the form a V form, that is, first the model is built, then development is carried out and finally the project is validated by tests. This model is costly in terms of validation, as the flaws are found only in the final stage of production, making the correction more difficult and expensive. Currently, the so-called agile model is used, where several planning-development-testing cycles are performed, making the process faster and more flexible. However, this model makes it impossible to carry out all the necessary tests in the production of a vehicle, as there is no time to execute them, and it is not necessary to test certain functions at all stages of the project. Given the need to select a limited amount of test for each stage of the project, the study of how to select automatically and safely is necessary. The objective of the project presented here is to study ways to select tests according to the software's functionalities, as well as the relationship between the reliability of the system in relation to the tests performed.

The internship took place at Renault Software Labs in Toulouse, a research and development division of the Renault group. Such a project is a doctoral thesis proposal, so during the 6-month internship, the initial phases were developed: data collection and preparation. The collected data refer to the description of the tests in the Renault catalog, the history of the execution of these tests and also the defects found by them during the software validation phase for connected vehicles. In addition, an initial bibliographic study was carried out in order to identify the different existing approaches and methodologies. Finally, analyzes were performed on the information acquired and the relevance of each in relation to the test results.
