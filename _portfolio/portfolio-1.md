My PhD study was on the domain of software testing, specifically focus on the Regression Testing Problem (RTP). A regression test is used to verify if all functionalities of the software work after an introduction of a new feature. This type of test can detect regressions on the source code. However, they usually require more time to execute, so if there are a large number of regression tests, it is necessary to chose which ones will be executed in each version. To resolve the problem, we can find three big approaches in the literature: prioritization, selection, and minimization.

In this work, I investigate the following challenge: among the many existing RT methods, how to determine which ones are suitable for a specific industrial context? The thesis investigates a taxonomy-based approach to assist practitioners in the characterization of their RT problem, the selection of feasible candidate solutions and their evaluation in the industrial context. The contributions are the following: 1) the proposal of an approach that builds on a recent taxonomy of RT concepts, allowing for an alignment between RT problems and candidate RT solutions; 2) an empirical assessment of the approach through a real-world case study, involving two software systems embedded into connected vehicles; 3) feedback on the usability of the taxonomy; 4) feedback on the real-world problem, including the constraints faced in the evaluation of RT methods, and the results of this evaluation. The approach delivered on its promise, enabling the identification of RT methods suitable for the studied problem. However, this success came at the cost of difficulties due to unclear taxonomy elements, missing ones, and errors in the taxonomy-based classif! ication of methods. We conclude that the proposed alignment between problems and solution is relevant in principle, but that the taxonomy would have to mature. Our work identifies avenues for improvement.

The thesis was a collaboration between Renault Group and the laboratory LAAS-CNRS (Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems). At LAAS, I’m part of the group TSF (Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance). This work was under the academic supervision of Hélène Waeselynck and the industrial guidance of Fernand Cuesta.
